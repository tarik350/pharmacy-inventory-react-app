                <p className="paragraph">
                  One of the fundamental aspects of maintaining data security is
                  ensuring the use of strong passwords. Weak or easily guessable
                  passwords pose a significant risk to the confidentiality of
                  your pharmacy inventory data. Samaritan encourages users to
                  create passwords that are unique, complex, and not easily
                  associated with personal information. By incorporating a
                  combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and
                  special characters, you can significantly enhance the strength
                  of your password.

                  Implementing two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of
                  security to your Samaritan account. By requiring a second
                  verification step, such as a unique code sent to your mobile
                  device, 2FA ensures that only authorized individuals can
                  access your account. Enabling this feature provides an
                  additional safeguard against unauthorized access, even if your
                  password is compromised.

                  To maintain the integrity of your account, it is essential to

                  least every three to six months, you minimize the risk of
